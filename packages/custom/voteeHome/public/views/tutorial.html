To begin Votee, create an account by click the "Join" button on the front page.  Next, enter your information

or login and vote as a student.  Both students and professors have the ability to track their votes.  Click on View Grades or 
View Courses on your student page to view your courses in progress or the scores you have achieved on previous Votee quizzes.
