The child would get a notification and it would be added to a to do list until it was completed and the parents are notified.\nAnother use would be scheduling such as whose going to drive the kid to their game or who is going to be home to take the dog out at a specific time, whose going to cook supper that night etc. \nNot really sure how good this idea is but thought I'd throw it out there!",
