<p>Rather than purchasing a clunky, dedicated clicker, you are now able to use Votee through your smartphones, tablets, or laptops for free. By signing in to your account and checking in to your current classroom, you will be prompted with the professor’s daily quiz. As each question and its corresponding possible answers are displayed, you can submit an answer with the touch of a button!

<p>Once the quiz closes, Votee can give you feedback based on your answer, and display the distribution of all classroom answers. Votee provides a visual experience as answers and marks are tracked as they go. Throughout the term all of your quiz grades can be reviewed allowing you to observe your progress and browse through previous votes, so you are able to get the most out of the Votee daily quizzes.
