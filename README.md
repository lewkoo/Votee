Votee is a classroom oriented voting software, perfect for improving the voting experience for both students and professors. Votee provides an interactive response system for classroom questions, and displays informative data for both students and professors. Votee will guide you through the term, making your daily quizzes a breeze while keeping you up to date on grades and progress. Votee is an all-in-one application for creating questions, submitting answers, classroom voting, and the organization of classroom results. 
 
If you are a professor in need of an interactive quiz solution for your classroom, do yourself a favour and stay organized with Votee. Create daily questions for your class using the software and track the progress of your students based on quiz results. Several forms of questions can be created to keep your class on top! Once a question has been created, set a time frame for completion and allocate marks. Then watch Votee do the rest! If visualization helps you, Votee can display several statistics of your classroom results in chart form. Observing student progress and tracking performance are some of many benefits of the Votee software.
 
Now that you have created your set of questions, it is time for the students to get to work! Rather than purchasing a clunky, dedicated clicker, students are able to use Votee through their smartphones, tablets, or laptops for free. By signing in to their account and checking in to their current classroom, students will be prompted with the professorâ€™s daily quiz. As each question and its corresponding possible answers are displayed, the students can submit their answer with the touch of a button. Once the quiz closes, Votee can give feedback to each student based on their answer, and display the distribution of classroom answers. Votee provides a visual experience as the students answers and marks are tracked as they go. Throughout the term all quiz grades can be reviewed allowing the student to observe their progress and browse through previous votes, so they get the most out of the Votee daily quizzes.
 
At Votee, we care about your classrooms integrity as much as you do. The Votee app ensures students are in the classroom before accepting answers. When a student is outside your university network, Votee will not allow the student to vote, preventing answers from outside the classroom. As a result, Votee helps improve classroom attendance, as marks will not be allocated to class skippers!
 
Votee is your all-in-one application and handy classroom voting software. As a professor you will find yourself better prepared, more informed, and better organized. Students will find participation more simple, enjoyable and valuable to their education. Votee benefits everyone in a classroom and is therefore the best choice for a class voting software. If you want a better voting experience, vote Votee.

### Votee is built on MEAN Stack, a single solution for a robust web service

We choose MEAN Stack for a few reasons, chief of those we have outlined below: 
* MEAN is a complete stack, composed of a database, a web server, back end and front end logic engine and modern front end styling tools
* MongoDM is one of the world most widely used non-relational database. Looking at the potential data that will be stored in Votee, non-relational databases seem like a good fit
* Node.js is a light weight sever built on JavaScript. It was specifically tuned for the MEAN stack and it includes a tool called *gulp* - a configuration manager and deployment tool, which will be handy when dealing with managing production and development instances of the live server, as well as continuous integration
* MEAN comes with AngularJS and Bootstrap for easy and fast front end logic and styling. This will allow us to prototype many diffurent UI options when developing Votee
* MEAN itself is a big framework with a large community and good documentation. It also includes packages - bundles of reusable code that bring in extra features that are commonly requested in web service applications
* MEAN comes with testing build - in. Frameworks for running and executing unit and acceptance testing are provided. 
* Best of all - all of MEAN code is JavaScript and JSON, so there is no need for developers to switch between and learn many programming languages
