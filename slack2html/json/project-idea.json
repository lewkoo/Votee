I thought we could do some sort of downtown parking app. So based on your location or destination it could find the closet surface lot or parkade and check if there are any available spots.

However, it is very data-driven project. First, we need a large dataset of parking spots for it to be useable. Secondly, we want to somehow get the parking spots count \u2026 \n\nhm, I am just thinking how we would manage the parking data in terms of how many spots are available. I guess once a user parks, we can ask for an estimate on how many spots are available around the user. Since people do tend to park as far away from other cars as possible, this estimation would work well. \n\nFor attendants, we can develop a mobile app and an API to report the numbers. Large, automated car parks can report their counts automatically via the API \u2026 \n\nGood idea. I guess I\u2019ll throw in what I\u2019ve got so far: \n\n- iClicker replacement: why do we have to buy them? Let\u2019s build an app to do the same thing! I think it is a simple idea, yet there is a little bit of complexity to it. There are at least 2 target users - profs and students. There is an obvious usage to the mobile app. Web app can be used to both cast your vote and also to make questions, get results, etc. \n- Community translator app - allows you to request a translation of some text from people around the world. Rating based - kind of like Stack Overflow, but more like Airbnb :simple_smile: here, both mobile and web experience are pretty much identical, except that web gives you more functionality.","ts":"1452381373.000012"},{"type":"message","user":"U0J3A5RML","text":"I like the iClicker replacement.","ts":"1452438591.000002"},{"type":"message","user":"U0J3A5RML","text":"Another idea would be an RSS news reader","ts":"1452438615.000003"},{"type":"message","user":"U0HV1T7F1","text":"Parking app is a nice idea, however it is very data driven indeed.
